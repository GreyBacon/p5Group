Given your team mates' three new Bootstrap components, create one master template html photo gallery and detail page. This master file
should combine all bootstrap features from each team mate. The master example should load, and demonstrate each feature we 
have also taught from phases 1-3, in terms of topics such as url parameters, cookies, array iteration, and jquery. Your new
master file should be useful, in phase 6, as a template for the team members to use to create one, uniform site.
